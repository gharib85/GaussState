# GaussState
Mathematica package for working with quantum-optical covariance matrices.


This package contains tools for
* the calculation of covariance matrices of Gaussian states and
* the evaluation of certain entanglement measures on the level of these covariance matrices.

## Installation und Usage
* To install, clone the repository into $UserBaseDirectory/Applications. 
* Open the Mathematica notebook GaussState.nb for further hints on how to use it.

## Warning
This package has not been systematically tested. Use at your own peril!
